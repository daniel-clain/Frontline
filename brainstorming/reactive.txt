* state is data that affects the view
* data only changes as a possible cause of an event
* if the event doesnt change the state, then the ui doesnt change
* the view should observe the state and react to the data change
* the amount of code between the action and the data storage, and the amound of code between the data update reaction and the ui changing should be minimal.
